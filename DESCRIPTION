Description: Provides 'dplyr' verbs for lists and other useful 
    verbs for manipulation of data frames. In particular, it includes a 
    mutate_which() function that mutates columns for a specific subset of 
    rows defined by a condition, and fuse() which is a more flexible version 
    of 'tidyr' unite() function.
